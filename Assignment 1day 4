#question : Print the first ArmStrong number in the range of 1042000 to 702648265 and exit the as soon as you encounter the first armstrong number. Use while loop
#solution :

lower = 1042000
upper = 702648265

for Number in range(lower, upper + 1):
   # order of number
   order = len(str(Number))
    
   # initialize sum
   sum = 0

   temp = Number
   while temp > 0:
       digit = temp % 10
       sum += digit ** order
       temp //= 10

   if Number == sum:
       print(Number)
       break
